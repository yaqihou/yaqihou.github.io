<!-- ## Research Interest -->

<!-- My interests include improving and developing numerical methods for quantum -->
<!-- many-body systems. -->

<!-- I have been working on improving conventional **Determinant Quantum Monte -->
<!-- Carlo** for simulating large-scale system as well as developing a new -->
<!-- method coined as **Automated Algebra Method** to calculate virial -->
<!-- coefficients. -->

<!-- I am also exploring machine-learning-based techniques in the context of -->
<!-- quantum many-body systems. Currently I am looking into training Neural Network as an estimator to -->
<!-- apply inverse of a complicated matricx arising in QMC. Another interesting -->
<!-- topic is to investigate the possibility and usability to apply knowlegde -->
<!-- graph in physics. -->

## Technical Skills


For the programming skills, I am proficient in **Python** and **Fortran** and interacted with them on a daily basis. In more details,

{:style="width: 95%; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto"}
| **Python** | I am very familiar with packages like **Numpy**, **Scipy**, and **MatPlotLib**. I have experience with **multiprocessing** and **Cython**. <br> Regarding the machine learning frameworks, I mainly used **PyTorch** and, occassionally, need to interact with projects relying on **TensorFlow** or **scikit-learn**. <br> I also used **pandas** and **seaborn** for panel data and (easier) visualization <!--(though I still prefer the feel of control to tune everythingusing MatPloblib ) --> <br> I also built CLI and GUI applitions and utilities using packages like **PyQt5** (GUI), **curses** (CLI) **sqlite3** and **selenium**. |
| **Fortran** | I have experience with **OpenMP** and **MPI** for parallel computation on clusters, and relied on **AOCL** and **FFTW** for the research.  |
| **Lua**  | I used [Awesome WM](https://awesomewm.org/) as my window manager, whose configuration is based on Lua. I also built several packages to extends its functions. |
| **Emacs-lisp** &nbsp; &nbsp; | `M-x all-hail-emacs` (and `alias vim=emacs`, well, just kidding, I am an [EVIL](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) user). I have been using Emacs for nearly a decade, still a newbie by the community standard. I have extended/built/contributed to multiple packages in Emacs-lisp. Though I have to be honest that I have never learned Lisp in a systematic way.  |
| **Linux** | I have used Linux as the only working environment for 6 years (so many thanks to Stadia saving me from switching the OS for the entertainment). I am familiar with the concepts and managed my personal server. I also managed the group's computation server and worked on remote clusters. |
| **Scripting** | I have programmed many utilities on `zsh` and familiar with most common programs such as  |
| **Git** | I used git (and thank you, [Magit](https://magit.vc/) ) on a daily basis for version controls of my codes and documents. |
| **Other** | Though I am now making all my slides in LaTeX Beamer, I am also experienced in PowerPoint.  <br> I learned HTML and CSS for this website, which is based on Jekyll but with a heavily-customized theme.|
