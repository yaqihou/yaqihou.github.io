## Research Interest

My interests include improving and developing numerical methods for quantum
many-body systems.

I have been working on improving conventional **Determinant Quantum Monte
Carlo** for simulating large-scale system as well as developing a new
method coined as **Automated Algebra Method** to calculate virial
coefficients.

I am also exploring machine-learning-based techniques in the context of
quantum many-body systems. Currently I am looking into training Neural Network as an estimator to
apply inverse of a complicated matricx arising in QMC. Another interesting
topic is to investigate the possibility and usability to apply knowlegde
graph in physics.

## Teaching Experience

I have been Graduate Teaching Assistant for both undergraduate courses and graduate courses including:


- PHYS 114 - General Physics for non-physics major, led workshop as **Teaching Assistant**
  <!-- (Fall 2016, Summer 2017) -->
- PHYS 118 - General Physics for physics major, led workshop as **Teaching Assistant**
  <!-- (Spring 2017 - Spring 2018) -->
- PHYS 331 - Introductory numerical techniques in physcis, led lab session and gave mini-lectures as **Teaching Assistant**
  <!-- (Fall 2018) -->
- PhD qualification exam recitation - statistieal physics, led recitation session as **Instructor**
  <!-- (Spring 2019) -->

## Technical Skills

I am proficient in **Python** and **Fortran**, which are the major tools in
my daily research.

- In Python, I am very familiar with packages like
**Numpy**, **Scipy** as well as **MatPlotLib**. I have some experience with
**multiprocessing** and **Cython**. Regarding the machine learning
frameworks, I programmed mainly with **pyTorch** but also have some
experience with **TensorFlow**.
- In Fortran, I have some experience with
**OpenMP** and **MPI** for parallel computation on clusters. The
**AOCL** and **FFTW** are two of the most frequently used libs in my
research.
- As part of my personal interests, I also interacts with **Qt** (PyQt5), **sqlite3** and **selenium** frequently.

I have been an **Emacs** user for nearly 8 years, which powers most of my
work and life. I have built a few tiny packages in **E-Lisp** (though never
published them on www).

**Linux** is my daily and only working environment: I therefore have some
experience in **Shell Scipt Programming**. I use [Awesome
WM](https://awesomewm.org/) because, well, it is really awesome! And thanks to it,
I also programmed a bunch of widgets in **Lua**. On the clusters, I am familiar with **HTCondor**, which is used in [Open Science Grid (OSG)](https://opensciencegrid.org/)

I am also experienced in **Git** (and all hail to
[Magit](https://magit.vc/)) and familiar with the workflow on
[GitHub](https://github.com/yaqihou).
