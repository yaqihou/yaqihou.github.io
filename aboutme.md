# About Me

## Education

- PhD candidate in Physics, **University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill**, _Aug 2016_ to _May 2021_ 

- B.S in Physics, **Shandong University**, *Sep 2011* to *Jun 2015*

## Research Interest

My interests include improving and developing numerical methods for quantum systems. I have been working on improving conventional Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo for simulating large-scale system as well as developing a new method to calculate virial coefficients.

Also I am exploring the direction that bring into physics the ideas from machine learning. Currently I am looking into training Neural Network as an estimator to apply inverse of a complicated matricx arising in QMC. Another interesting topic is to investigate the possibility and usability to apply knowlegde graph in physics.

## Teaching Experience

I have been Graduate Teaching Assistant for both undergraduate courses and graduate courses including:

- PHYS 114 - General Physics for non-physics major, led workshop as *Teaching Assistant*

  <!-- (Fall 2016, Summer 2017) -->

- PHYS 118 - General Physics for physics major, led workshop as *Teaching Assistant*

  <!-- (Spring 2017 - Spring 2018) -->

- PHYS 331 - Introductory numerical techniques in physcis, led lab session as *Teaching Assistant*

  <!-- (Fall 2018) -->

- PhD qualification exam recitation - statistieal physics, led recitation session as *Instructor*

  <!-- (Spring 2019) -->

## Technical Skills

I am proficient in **Python** and **Fortran**, which are the major tool in my daily research.
In Python, I am very familiar with packages like **Numpy**, **Scipy** as well as **MatPlotLib**. I have some experience with **multiprocessing** and **Cython**. To explore the machine learning, I started to learn **pyTorch** about two months ago. Also used in several of my side projects are **Qt** (PyQt5), **sqlite3** and **pandas**.
In Fortran, I use **OpenMP** and **MPI** for parallel computation on cloud cluster and am familiar with a set of **BLAS** and **FFTW** APIs.

I am an daily user of **Emacs**, which powers most of my work and life, so I have built several packages in **E-Lisp**. I work under **Linux** environment everyday and also have limited experience in server maintaince. On Linux, using Awesome WM offers me chances to config and write few packages in **Lua**.

I am also proficient with **LaTeX**, which, together with _org-mode_, powers all my writings and presentations, as well as **Git** to organize all my projects.
