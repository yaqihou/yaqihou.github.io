<!-- ## Research Interest -->

<!-- My interests include improving and developing numerical methods for quantum -->
<!-- many-body systems. -->

<!-- I have been working on improving conventional **Determinant Quantum Monte -->
<!-- Carlo** for simulating large-scale system as well as developing a new -->
<!-- method coined as **Automated Algebra Method** to calculate virial -->
<!-- coefficients. -->

<!-- I am also exploring machine-learning-based techniques in the context of -->
<!-- quantum many-body systems. Currently I am looking into training Neural Network as an estimator to -->
<!-- apply inverse of a complicated matricx arising in QMC. Another interesting -->
<!-- topic is to investigate the possibility and usability to apply knowlegde -->
<!-- graph in physics. -->
