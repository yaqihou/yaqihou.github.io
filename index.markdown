# Hello there!

I am a PhD candidate in Physics at UNC-Chapel Hill. Currently, I am in the 4th year and plan to graduate in May 2021. I work under the supervision of [Prof. Joaquin Drut](https://users.physics.unc.edu/~drut/public_html_UNC/) and focus on the computational and analytical methods for quantum gases. I obtained my B.S. degree in Physics from Shangdong University, China in 2015.
