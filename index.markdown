# About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Physics at UNC-Chapel Hill. Currently, I am in the 4th year and plan to graduate in May 2021. I work under the supervision of [Prof. Joaquin Drut](https://users.physics.unc.edu/~drut/public_html_UNC/) and focus on the computational and analytical methods for quantum gases. I obtained my B.S. degree in Physics from Shangdong University, China in 2015.

Besides physics, machine learning is another field that of my interest. I am currently focusing on the interdisciplinary research of machine learning and physics.

More information about me could be found in my [CV](CV/Yaqi-Hou-CV.pdf) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaqi-hou/). Some of my personal projects could also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/yaqihou) (and a category with short summary of each project [here](/github_intro)) while most codes related to my research are served privately within the group.
