# Research in Physics

My research focuses on computational aspects of the quantum many-body problem.


As part of my proposal, I am now working on two directions: 

## Automated Algebra Method

Most of my PhD research devotes to an novel, semi-classical method coined
as Automated Algebra (AA) method. This idea roots from the work of my
advisor Joaquin Drut and his student Christoper Shill in their publication
[](). They explored only the leading-order calculation and .

I took over this method in my third year and has beening working on developing both its formalism and implementation since then.

Below, I describet

Besides the two wosk  of papers in this direction verifies the applicability of our method in different systems: we apply it

### Thermaldynamics and Tan's contant in various systems {{ page.tag_published }}

### Search for pseudogap regime in the Unitary Fermi Gas {{ page.tag_published }}

In this collaboration with the
[group](https://theorie.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de/fermions/people_braun.html)
from TU Darmsdadt, in Germany, we studied the paring behaviour of the
Unitary Fermi Gas in the normal phase, looking for signatures of 

My work in this paper served as a benchmark for the results from conventional stochastic methods. Crucially, my results are smooth functions, as they are analytic expressions, and not only validate but also extend the stochastic results, which are discrete.

In this project, I keep the generalization of AA method

### Dilute Neutron Matter System <span class="mytag tag_doing">ongoing</span>

Dilute neutron matter, as in the crust of a neutron star, belongs to the same universal class as

# Projects in Computer Science

As a personal interest, I conducted a few research projects in computer science,

### Enhanced attention mechanism using CNN {{ page.tag_hold }}

In this project, I aimed to explore
