# Research in Physics

My research focuses on computational aspects of the quantum many-body problem.

Below, I organize my research according to the 

## Automated Algebra Method

#### Thermodynamics Calculation using Automated Algebra Method [Finished]

Besides the two wosk  of papers in this direction verifies the applicability of our method in different systems: we apply it  

- Phys. Rev. Research 3, 033099 (2021)

#### Dynamic Response Calculation [Ongoing]

#### Dilute Neutron Matter System [Ongoing]

Dilute neutron matter, as in the crust of a neutron star, belongs to the same universal class as 

## Stochastic Method

#### Energy of bosonic droplets

#### Energy of bosonic droplets

#### Enhanced Linear Solver for Complex Langevin Method [Ongoing]

#### Machine-learning based random field [Early stage]


# Projects in Computer Science

As a personal interest, I conducted a few research projects in computer science, 

#### Quantum Matter Map

#### Enhanced Attention Mechanism using CNN

As an alternative diretion to pursing even-larger-scale deep networks, it is of interests to polish and refine the performance of its basic building block: the attention mechanism.
