# Research in Physics

My research interests in 

## Thermodynamics Calculation using Automated Algebra Method

## Dynamic Response Calculation

## Dilute Neutron Matter System

Dilute neutron matter, as in the crust of a neutron star, belongs to the same universal class as 


# Research in Computer Science

As a personal interests

## Quantum Matter Map

## Enhanced Attention Mechanism using CNN

As an alternative diretion to pursing even-larger-scale deep networks, it is of interests to polish and refine the performance of its basic building block: the attention mechanism.

<!-- My research focuses on numerical and analytical methods on quantum many-body problem, which is an essential  -->

<!-- My latest work is to develop an novel method to predict virial coefficients of interacting Fermi systems. This  -->
