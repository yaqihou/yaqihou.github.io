# Academic

My academic research focuses on developing novel computational methods for quantum many-body systems, with applications ranging from ultracold atomic gases to neutron star physics. Through my PhD at UNC-Chapel Hill, I have contributed to advancing our understanding of quantum matter through innovative theoretical and computational approaches.

## Research Areas

### Quantum Many-Body Systems
**PhD Research at UNC-Chapel Hill (2016-2022)**

My primary research contribution has been the development of novel computational methods for simulating quantum matter, with particular focus on strongly correlated fermion systems.

#### Automated Algebra Method for Virial Expansion

- **Innovation**: Created a semi-analytical computational framework that eliminates statistical errors in quantum many-body calculations
- **Impact**: Achieved unprecedented accuracy in calculating higher-order virial coefficients (up to 5th order) 
- **Technical Achievement**: Implemented efficient algorithms using Python/Cython with multiprocessing and distributed computing on Open Science Grid
- **Breakthrough**: Resolved long-standing discrepancies between theory and experiment in quantum gas thermodynamics

#### Key Accomplishments
- **Methodological Innovation**: Developed scalable algorithms that reduced computation time from years to days for complex quantum calculations
- **Cross-disciplinary Impact**: Methods applicable to both ultracold atomic gases and neutron star matter
- **International Collaboration**: Worked with theoretical groups in Germany on quantum matter applications
- **Publications**: 6 peer-reviewed papers including Editor's Suggestion in Physical Review Letters

### Machine Learning Applications in Physics

- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks**: Explored ML-enhanced random field generation for quantum Monte Carlo methods
- **Transformer Models**: Applied attention mechanisms to accelerate stochastic simulations
- **NLP in Scientific Computing**: Developed event extraction methods for COVID-19 data analysis
